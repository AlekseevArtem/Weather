# Weather

This is my project "Weather". It's shows the weather from a location that it receives using GPS. Makes a request using Retrofit to the service https://openweathermap.org/api. Saves a request to Room using Coroutine. You can also get the weather from anywhere by clicking on the magnifying glass using the "Places API" from Google. MVP architecture(Moxy). Also used the Dagger library to inject Room and Retrofit dependencies into the presenter.
